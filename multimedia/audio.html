<p> "With the notable exception of its 1994 breakout single, “What Would You Say,” Dave Matthews Band 
has always been more about sound than songs. This continues to be true on the group’s propulsive new album, 
Before These Crowded Streets. Teaming up again with producer Steve Lillywhite, DMB is more successful on 
this outing than ever before in translating the roiling energy of its stage show to the studio. 
The band also pushes in adventurous new directions, incorporating bright new hues into its highly distinctive, 
instantly recognizable sonic palette. </p>

<p>DMB’s lethal secret weapon has always been its extraordinary — and 
criminally underpraised — rhythm section. If you want to organize a band with a front line of
 violin, saxophone, and acoustic and electric guitars, and your music relies on tricky time signatures,
  complex arrangements and fevered ensemble playing that bolts into reckless improvisational flights,
   your drummer and bass player better swing like Joe DiMaggio. Stefan Lessard and Carter Beauford 
   more than fill the bill — they anchor this unwieldy outfit without ever weighing it down. 
   And when it’s time to fly, they give the band wings." - ANTHONY DECURTIS, Rollingstone.com
